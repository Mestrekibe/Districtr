          The goal of Districtr is to
          <strong>put the tools of redistricting in the hands of the public</strong>, particularly
          civil rights organizations and community groups.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Districtr came about from a conversation with
          <a href="http://lawyersforcivilrights.org/">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>, the Boston arm
          of the national
          <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/">Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a>.
          LCR was describing their work with community members in Lowell,
          MA, who were frustrated about not having a voice with the city
          council. In those conversations, a few places kept coming up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like <mark>Clemente Park</mark>, a much-loved meeting point for the
          city’s Asian and Latino populations, which felt unsafe at night
          because the city had not provided lighting in the park.
        </p>

        <p>
          And <mark>Lowell High School</mark>, the city’s only public high
          school, which serves over 3000 students. The city announced plans to
          move it from its traditional downtown location, but did not invest
          in substantial outreach to communities of color about possible new
          sites.
        </p>
        <p class="takeaway">
          Our idea was to create a mapping tool whose fundamental principle is
          to
          <strong>ask the community what matters.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          With maps that show relevant landmarks and data, users can try their
          own hand at drawing meaningful demonstration plans.
